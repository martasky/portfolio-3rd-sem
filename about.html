          I see every project as an opportunity to grow professionally and
          develop my skills, therefore I put a lot of effort in it. I won’t stop
          until I find a solution. That means sometimes I can’t sleep because Im
          thinking about the code.

          During my educations I gained a lot of knowledge in various topics
          like UX and UI design, as well as content creation but I very quickly
          realized that what excits me is HTML, CSS and Javascript. I enjoy
          interactive websites a lot, that’s why I would like to explore the
          animation further.

        <p>
          Im currently looking for an internship, which will help me to develop
          my coding skills. In my free time I like going to
          <span id="festivals">festivals</span> and concerts, wandering in the
          <span id="mountains">mountains</span>, visiting
          <span id="art">art galleries</span> and growing weird
          <span id="vegetables">vegetables</span> on my balcony.
