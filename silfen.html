        <h2>What was it about</h2>
        <p>
          In this group project we had to analyse the brand and redesign their
          website, so it expresses their values better. The main focus was to
          create a user-friendly purchase flow. The task was to improve the
          current one so it was more intuitive as well as organize better the
          information architecture.

        <h2>New coding skills</h2>
        <p>
          It was for sure the most complex project regarding coding. We created
          a fully functional website. We used database to store all the
          information about products. In order to make our website dynamic we
          fetched all data using JS. I learnt how to manipulate the cart content
          and I was introduced to the concept of local storage and url params
          method.
